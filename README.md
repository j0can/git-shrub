## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please follow these steps:

1. Fork the Repository
   - Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the GitHub page
   - This creates your own copy of the repository under your GitHub account
   - Note: Direct cloning and pushing to the main repository is not allowed

2. Set Up Your Fork
   - Clone your forked repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/git-shrub.git
     ```
   - Add the original repository as upstream:
     ```bash
     git remote add upstream https://github.com/j0can/git-shrub.git
     ```

3. Keep Your Fork Updated
   - Regularly sync your fork with the upstream:
     ```bash
     git fetch upstream
     git checkout main
     git merge upstream/main
     ```

4. Make Your Changes
   - Create a new branch for your feature:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
     ```
   - Make your changes and commit them
   - Push to your fork:
     ```bash
     git push origin feature/your-feature-name
     ```

5. Submit a Pull Request
   - Go to your fork on GitHub
   - Click "New Pull Request"
   - Select your feature branch
   - Describe your changes in detail
   - Note: All PRs must be reviewed and approved before merging

### Repository Access Rules

- The main repository is private and can only be accessed through forks
- Direct commits to the master branch are restricted
- All changes must be submitted through Pull Requests
- Pull Requests require review and approval
- Only repository administrators can merge approved Pull Requests

### Common Forking Issues and Solutions

1. Out-of-Date Fork
   - **Issue**: Your fork becomes outdated as the main repository evolves
   - **Solution**: Regularly sync your fork with upstream (see step 3 above)

2. Merge Conflicts
   - **Issue**: Changes in your fork conflict with upstream changes
   - **Solution**: Resolve conflicts locally after syncing with upstream

3. Multiple Pull Requests
   - **Issue**: Managing multiple feature branches
   - **Solution**: Create separate branches for each feature/fix

4. Branch Management
   - **Issue**: Working on wrong branch
   - **Solution**: Always create new feature branches from updated main
