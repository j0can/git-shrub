    * üé® `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
    * üêé `:racehorse:` when improving performance
    * üìù `:memo:` when writing docs
    * üêõ `:bug:` when fixing a bug
    * üî• `:fire:` when removing code or files

### C Style Guide

* Use 4 spaces for indentation
* Maximum line length is 80 characters
* Use descriptive variable names
* Comment your code, but don't overdo it
* Function names should be in snake_case
* Constants should be in UPPER_CASE
* Always use braces for control structures, even for single-line blocks

## Documentation Styleguide

* Use Markdown

* Use headers appropriately (# for main title, ## for sections, etc.)
